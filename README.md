## Features

- **One-Click Operation:** Easily replace the skin in your Minecraft wallpaper without the need for 3D design tools.

- **Customizability:** Apply your favorite skin to Minecraft wallpapers, making your wallpaper truly unique.

- **Have eyes!:** The tool allows for easy rendering of eyes through RGB colors, enhancing the visual appeal of the minecraft renderings. 

- **Suitable for Minecraft and Beyond:** While initially designed for Minecraft wallpapers, the same principle applies to other renderings, provided they meet the preparation requirements.

## Prerequisites

Please note that this tool is suitable for renderings where:

- Each pixel in Original Texture (the texture to be changed) has a unique color.
- Renderings are created with layered rendering techniques.
  - bcz we need the **material_color_map** to change textures!

## Installation

1. Go to the folder you want to place the tool and get in your terminal, (all the commands below are runned in the terminal!)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olozhika/Minecraft_Wallpaper_Replacer.git
   cd Minecraft_Wallpaper_Replacer
   ```
3. Make sure you have python and pip installed
4. install the requirements
   ```bash
   python requirements.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Right click and open the `eye_color_player.py` as a txt file, change the RGB colors within. Save the file. 
2. Make sure you can find the following folders or paths
   - the wallpaper templates folder
   - the output folder
     - *the folder will be automatically created if the path doesn't exist*
   - your skin
     - *note that the tool currently only support 64x64 skins*
3. In the terminal, fill the paths/folders below and run
   ```bash
   python Run_MCR.py --wallpaper_path= --output_path= --yourskin=
   ```
   you can also change the name of the eye_color_file to some `XXXXX` by adding `--eye_color_file=XXXXXX` to the command above
4. That's all!
   For example, by running
   ```bash
   python Run_MCR.py --wallpaper_path='wallpaper/Rep_test/Alex_1eyes' --output_path='output/olozhika' --yourskin='tex/olozhika472_NMO.png'
   ```
   one will get

   these files in the `output/olozhika` folder.
   And the final image looks like the one maked with blue.
